    <h4>Providing equivalent experiences since 2011</h4>
    <p>Aldebaran Interpreting and Third Eye Theater, owned and operated by Michelle Maphey, Sign Language Interpreter, is a small business, located in Jefferson County committed to providing quality professional interpreting services throughout the north
        country and beyond.</p>
    <p>The job of an interpreter is to bridge the communication gap between Deaf/Hard of Hearing and Hearing individuals. Adherence to a Code of Professional Conduct as outlined by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) which grants confidentiality
        to all parties involved in the communication process, is of utmost importance. It is important to note that not every person who can sign is an interpreter. Interpreters have a specialized set of skills in breaking down cultural and linguistic
        barriers, as well as a command of both languages involved.</p>
