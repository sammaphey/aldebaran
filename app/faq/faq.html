        <h3>RECENT QUESTIONS</h3>
        <p><b>How do I request a sign language interpreter?</b> You can request an interpreter on-line at <a href="http://www.aldebaraninterpretingservices.com">http://www.aldebaraninterpretingservices.com</a>. If you are unable to request interpreting services
            on-line please contact Aldebaran Interpreting Services at 315-955-5223, fax at 315-804-6541 or email at <a href="mailto:interpreting@aldebaraninterpretingservices.com">interpreting@aldebaraninterpretingservices.com</a>.</p>
        <p><b>How far in advance should I request Interpreting Services?</b> For best results, request should be made as soon as appointment or event is scheduled.</p>
        <p><b>Why is it necessary to fill out all requested information when requesting Interpreting Services?</b> Requests can be difficult to fill without all the required information. Filling all the requested information is necessary because it allows
            the interpreter to best prepare for the assignment. In addition, it ensures better tracking of requests, and helps with data collection and quality assurance on the services provided.</p>
        <p><b>When should I receive notification and status of my requests?</b> Under normal circumstances, Aldebaran Interpreting guarantees a one business day response time to confirm a request. The requester will receive confirmation (by email) letting
            him/her know that the request has been filled.</p>
        <h3>INTERPRETER QUESTIONS</h3>
        <p><b>Why do I need to Provide an Interpreter?</b> By using a Qualified Interpreter, you can be assured that the skills of the interpreter meet a national standard and satisfy ADA requirements, reducing your liability.</p>
        <p><b>Can’t a friend or family member interpret?</b> Communication is compromised when a friend or family member assumes the role of neutral, unbiased interpreter. Clients are entitled to a qualified interpreter.</p>
        <p><b>Why is it necessary to fill out all requested information when requesting Interpreting Services?</b> Requests can be difficult to fill without all the required information. Filling all the requested information is necessary because it allows
            the interpreter to best prepare for the assignment. In addition, it ensures better tracking of requests, and helps with data collection and quality assurance on the services provided.</p>
        <p><b>Why do interpreters need a team?</b> Assignments that are longer (for example, an all day staff training) require an interpreting team. Research has shown that prolonged interpreting contributes to an increase in errors and physical injury.
            Interpreter teams (composed of Deaf and/or Hearing Interpreters) work to ensure consistent quality for your clients. More complex situations with several D/HH/DB participants may require a team of several interpreters. Deaf-Blind participants
            using tactile interpreting will need a 1:1 ratio of interpreters.</p>
        <h3>MONETARY QUESTIONS</h3>
        <p><b>How do interpreters determine their rates?</b> Each interpreter sets his/her own rates.. Fees for a specific interpreting assignment will be negotiated based on unique circumstances such as travel time, length of assignment, amount of prep
            work needed, etc… In general, legal work and deaf-blind interpreting will increase the hourly rate. Interpreters are ethically bound to set reasonable rates.
            <a href="http://rid.org/ethics/code-of-professional-conduct/">(NAD/RID Code of Professional Conduct Tenet 6.8)</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Who is responsible for paying the interpreter?</b> Under Titles II&III of the ADA (<a href="https://www.ada.gov/">Americans with Disabilities Actof 1990</a>), the business entity, doctor’s office, dental practice, government agency, hospital,
            private organization, courthouse/jail, public entity, private or public school is responsible to provide communication access for individuals with disabilities. It is not the responsibility of the disabled individual to pay for accommodations.

        <p><b>Who pays the required taxes?</b> ndependently contracting interpreters are responsible to file their own taxes, maintain business licenses, pay professional dues, invest in continuing education to maintain professional, and maintain professional
            liability insurance. A hiring entity may be required by the IRS to report income over a certain amount paid to any one interpreter over a given year.</p>

        <h3>Dos and Don'ts</h3>
        <p><b>DO</b> speak clearly and at a normal pace.</p>
        <p><b>DO</b> address the Deaf or hard of hearing individual(s) personally and directly.</p>
        <p><b>DO</b> be Patient. The interpreter may be a sentence or two behind the person communicating. This is part of the interpreting process. Expect slight delays in getting responses to questions or in the next “turn” in the conversation.</p>
        <p><b>DO</b> allow the interpreter to place herself/himself appropriately. It is common for the interpreter to be situated near the hearing person, thus providing the necessary visual accessibility to the Deaf or hard of hearing conversation partner. Lighting,
            glare, and sight-lines are also important.</p>
        <p><b>DO</b> supply the interpreter with any materials, hand-outs, etc. for review, in order to facilitate a clearer interpretation. This is especially important with technical and detailed materials</p>
        <p><b style="color:red;">DON'T</b> try to include the interpreter as a member of the group activities or the discourse for which he or she is interpreting. The interpreter is there to provide a service.</p>
        <p><b style="color:red;">DON'T</b> direct questions or comments to the interpreter, “tell him…” or “ask her…..” is to risk alienating the Deaf person.</p>
        <p><b>DO</b> remember when making requests, we recommend doing so at least 2 weeks in advance to make sure we are able to confirm an interpreter.</p>
        <p><b>DO</b> contact Aldebaran Interpreting Service with as much advance notice as possible. Requests may be made by telephone, email, website. Submit the Interpreter Request Form or provide the following information:</p>
